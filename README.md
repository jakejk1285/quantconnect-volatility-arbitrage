## Strategy Description

The algorithm implements a contrarian volatility arbitrage approach that:

- **Universe Selection**: Dynamically selects the top 100 most liquid stocks (price > $20, daily volume > $10M) plus major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, SOL)
- **Signal Generation**: Combines Bollinger Bands, RSI, and trend filters to identify entry/exit points
- **Risk Management**: Implements position sizing, stop-losses, and portfolio exposure limits
- **Market Coverage**: Trades both equity and cryptocurrency markets for diversification

### Key Features

- **Multi-Asset Strategy**: Trades equities and cryptocurrencies simultaneously
- **Technical Indicators**: Custom implementations of Bollinger Bands, RSI, Historical Volatility, and Trend Filters
- **Risk Controls**: 5% stop-loss for longs, 3% for shorts, maximum 80% portfolio exposure
- **Dynamic Universe**: Automatically adapts to market conditions with liquid asset selection

## Algorithm Components

### Core Files

- **`main.py`**: Main algorithm class with initialization and data handling
- **`AssetStrategy.py`**: Trading strategy implementation with risk management
- **`Indicators.py`**: Custom technical indicator implementations

### Strategy Logic

1. **Long Entry**: Price < Lower Bollinger Band + RSI < 30 + Uptrend confirmed (price > 50-day SMA)
2. **Short Entry**: Price > Upper Bollinger Band + RSI > 70 + Downtrend confirmed (price < 50-day SMA)
3. **Long Exit**: Price reaches Middle Bollinger Band or 5% stop-loss triggered
4. **Short Exit**: Price reaches Middle Bollinger Band or 3% stop-loss triggered
5. **Position Sizing**: 5% allocation for longs, 3% for shorts with 80% max portfolio exposure

## Technical Indicators

### CustomBollingerBands
- **Period**: 20 days
- **Deviations**: 2 standard deviations
- **Usage**: Identifies potential reversal points
- **Implementation**: Contrarian approach - signals generated when price crosses bands, expecting mean reversion

### RSIIndicator  
- **Period**: 14 days
- **Thresholds**: Oversold (<30), Overbought (>70)
- **Usage**: Momentum oscillator confirming overbought/oversold conditions
- **Signal Logic**: RSI < 30 generates buy signals, RSI > 70 generates sell signals

### HistoricalVolatility
- **Period**: 20 days
- **Method**: Logarithmic returns standard deviation
- **Usage**: Confirms two standard deviation range for volatility assessment

### TrendFilter

### Strategy Logic and Group's Approach

Our team developed this volatility arbitrage strategy based on several key principles and behavioral finance theories:

#### Core Investment Philosophy
The strategy operates under two fundamental assumptions:
1. **Market Inefficiency**: Markets are not perfectly efficient, creating exploitable opportunities
2. **Mean Reversion**: Short-term price movements create opportunities to profit from mean-reversion tendencies after significant deviations

#### Technical Implementation Logic

**1. Contrarian Bollinger Bands**
- Traditional Bollinger Bands are lagging indicators, so we implemented them contrarian-style
- When price crosses the upper band, we sell (expecting reversion)
- When price crosses the lower band, we buy (expecting reversion)
- This contrarian approach better aligns with trend reversal timing

**2. Multi-Indicator Confirmation System**
- **RSI Filter**: Used as confirmation for Bollinger Band signals
  - RSI < 30 = Buy signal confirmation
  - RSI > 70 = Sell signal confirmation
- **Trend/Historical Volatility**: 50-day SMA trend evaluation prevents counter-trend trades
- This combination reduces false signals and background noise

**3. Behavioral Finance Foundation**
Our strategy exploits documented behavioral biases:
- **Overreaction & Herding**: Market overreactions to news create temporary mispricings that our contrarian approach captures
- **Overconfidence**: While retail investors ride momentum waves, our algorithm systematically identifies and trades reversals

#### Risk Management Philosophy
- **Position Sizing**: Long positions limited to 5% of portfolio, shorts to 3%
- **Stop Losses**: 5% for longs, 3% for shorts to limit downside
- **Portfolio Exposure**: Maximum 80% deployment to avoid over-leveraging
- **Liquidity Focus**: Top 100 stocks + 3 major cryptocurrencies ensures high liquidity

## Transaction Cost Analysis & Strategy Limitations

### Primary Challenge: Transaction Fees

**The biggest factor holding back our strategy's performance is transaction costs.** Our analysis shows that while the algorithm generates strong signals and captures volatility effectively, the high turnover rate (47.12%) results in substantial trading fees that significantly impact net profitability.

**Key Findings:**
- Q4 2023: Transaction fees of $1,005.79 on strong performance
- Q3 2025: Fees of $3,513.19 on $83.5M trading volume
- High turnover (47.12%) creates friction that erodes alpha generation
- Strategy shows excellent risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe 2.1+) but net profits suffer from costs

### Data Quality & Market Coverage

**Current Data Sources:**
- **Equity Data**: Top-tier providers via QuantConnect (Morningstar, Alpaca)
- **Cryptocurrency Data**: Coinbase and Binance feeds
- **Selection Criteria**: 
  - Equities: Daily volume >$10M, price >$20
  - Cryptos: BTC, ETH, SOL for high volatility and diversification
- **Data Handling**: Forward-filling and interpolation for continuity

### Strategy Shortcomings & Mitigation

**Identified Weaknesses:**
1. **Market Regime Dependency**: Works best in sideways markets, struggles in sustained bull runs
2. **Lagging Indicator Risk**: Bollinger Bands may miss rapid behavioral market reactions  
3. **Liquidity Traps**: Risk of unfavorable position exits during low liquidity
4. **Transaction Cost Sensitivity**: High-frequency signals create excessive trading costs

**Current Mitigations:**
- Top 100 stocks + 3 major cryptos ensure high liquidity
- Contrarian Bollinger Bands reduce lagging indicator issues
- Stop-losses limit maximum position losses
- Portfolio exposure caps prevent over-leveraging

### Potential Code Improvements for Fee Reduction

**If the code were to be modified, the primary focus would be transaction cost optimization:**

**1. Signal Filtering Enhancements**
- Implement minimum signal strength thresholds to reduce low-conviction trades
- Add position holding time minimums to prevent rapid entries/exits
- Create signal confidence scoring to prioritize high-probability setups

**2. Dynamic Position Sizing**
- Implement volatility-adjusted position sizing to reduce overtrading in high-vol periods
- Add transaction cost forecasting to position sizing calculations
- Create minimum trade size thresholds based on fee-to-profit ratios

**3. Exit Strategy Optimization**
- Implement trailing stops instead of fixed stop-losses to reduce premature exits
- Add time-based exits to prevent churning in ranging markets
- Create profit-taking levels that account for transaction costs

**4. Advanced Portfolio Management**
- Implement portfolio rebalancing constraints to limit unnecessary turnover
- Add correlation-based position limits to prevent over-concentration
- Create dynamic exposure management based on market regime detection

**5. Market Regime Adaptation**
- Add market volatility regime detection to adjust trading frequency
- Implement different parameter sets for trending vs. ranging markets
- Create momentum filters during strong directional moves to reduce contrarian trades

**Expected Impact:**
These modifications could potentially reduce turnover from 47% to 20-25% while maintaining signal quality, significantly improving net profitability by reducing the fee drag that currently limits strategy performance.
